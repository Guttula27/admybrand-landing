AI Usage Report – ADmyBRAND AI Suite Landing Page
For the development of the ADmyBRAND AI Suite landing page, I integrated AI tools into my workflow to significantly streamline the design and development process while maintaining full creative control and hands-on coding involvement. The primary tool used was ChatGPT-4o (OpenAI), which served as a powerful assistant in generating reusable UI components, solving framework-related issues, and applying modern web design patterns consistent with 2025 trends.

AI Tools Used
Primary AI Tool: ChatGPT-4o

Key Use Cases:

Generating modular and responsive components (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ)

Setting up the app/layout.tsx using Next.js 14+ App Router

Implementing Tailwind CSS with dark mode support

Writing animations using Intersection Observer and Framer Motion

Resolving build and deployment errors (e.g., Vercel deployment, clsx module issues)

Sample Prompts
“Build a responsive Hero section with glassmorphism and CTA using Tailwind.”

“Implement smooth scroll-triggered animations for landing sections.”

“Fix Next.js build error: Cannot find module ‘clsx’ during Vercel deployment.”

AI vs Manual Work Split
AI-generated: ~60%
AI was used for initial drafts of components, animation logic, and layout scaffolding. It also helped speed up the debugging process by explaining build errors and suggesting fixes.

Manual coding: ~40%
I personally wrote and refined much of the layout structure, integrated all UI components, ensured pixel-perfect responsiveness, handled section transitions, and polished visual elements across light and dark modes.

Customization:
While AI accelerated development, I took charge of aligning all content and styles with ADmyBRAND’s branding. I iteratively refined AI-generated code, adjusted styling, and optimized UX details to produce a professional and unique landing page experience.
